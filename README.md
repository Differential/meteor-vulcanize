Vulcanize
==============================================================================
Warning: API Change for version 1.0.0.

This package a meteor build plugin that wraps the [vulcanize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vulcanize) npm package, which is used to process web components into a single output file.

### Usage
1. Ensure all your components are located somewhere under your public directory. (via bower, zip, etc)
2. Include an `vulcanize.json` file in the root of your project.  This file will optionally define a path to the polyfill and paths to html imports for your components.  For Example:

````
{
    "polyfill": "/bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents.min.js",
    "imports": [
        "/bower_components/paper-button/paper-button.html",
        "/bower_components/paper-checkbox/paper-checkbox.html"
    ]
}
````
- By specifying a path to the polyfill we can ensure that it is injected into the bundle before any imports.

- Running your app in development as usual will result in individual imports being added to your `<head>` tag, resulting in multiple subsequent HTTP requests (good in development - debugging).

- Running `meteor`, `meteor build`, `modulus deploy`, etc with the `VULCANIZE=true` environment variable set will result in all your html imports being vulcanized or concatenated into a single html import (good in production).  The resulting file will be called `vulcanized-{md5}.html`, which will be automatically added to your `<head>` tag.  For example, `VULCANIZE=true meteor`, `VULCANIZE=true modulus deploy`.

- Setting the `CDN_PREFIX` environment variable will prepend the string to the beginning of the file path that is inserted into your HTML's `<head>` tag.
